# ECG DB
This project combines open source ECG datasets with Rhythm labels. 

## Datasets
### 1. AF Classification from a short single lead ECG recording: the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017
The [2017 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge](https://www.physionet.org/challenge/2017/) aims to encourage the development of 
algorithms to classify, from a single short ECG lead recording (between 30 s and 60 s in length), whether the recording 
shows normal sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation (AF), an alternative rhythm, or is too noisy to be classified.

### 2. MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database
This database includes 25 long-term ECG recordings of human subjects with atrial fibrillation (mostly paroxysmal). Of 
these, 23 records include the two ECG signals (in the .dat files); records 00735 and 03665 are represented only by the 
rhythm (.atr) and unaudited beat (.qrs) annotation files.

### 2. MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database
This database includes 18 long-term ECG recordings of subjects referred to the Arrhythmia Laboratory at Boston's Beth 
Israel Hospital (now the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center). Subjects included in this database were found to have 
had no significant arrhythmias; they include 5 men, aged 26 to 45, and 13 women, aged 20 to 50.
